## I want to build a grammoji, what should it look like?ðŸ™„
You can create anything you want (objects, animals etc).
But be careful do not create emojis ex. :-) Plus we will review your grammoji
to see if there are any similar projects or problems.

## Any extra advice? 
It would be nice if you create characters that are suitable for all social media networks.
ex. Consider the word restriction when someone will use a grammoji on Twitter.(Use tabs over spaces)
Don't worryðŸ˜“ if some grammojis look weird on twitter or facebook.
