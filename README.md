# Grammojis
Characters created from numbers and letters that give personality to your tweets and posts.

# Do I need permission to use them?
No, all grammojis(characters) can be used by anyone for anything.

# I want to build a character, what should he look like?
You can create anything you want (objects, animals etc).
But be careful do not create emojis ex. :-) Plus we will review your character
to see if there are any similar projects or problems.

# Any extra advice?
It would be nice if you create characters that are suitable for all social media networks.
ex. Consider the word restriction when someone will use a grammoji on Twitter.
